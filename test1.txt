[] Test DeepWorkCLI
[] Test making this a subtask

Can I ignore this line and have it be removed from my triage list?

Make this a note on another task

Here are some tasks to test reordering
[] Do this task last
[] Work on this task first
[] Put this task at the very top

------- Triage 01:10 PM -------
[] Put this task at the very top
[] Test DeepWorkCLI
  [] Test making this a subtask
  Make this a note on another task
[] Work on this task first
[] Do this task last

------- Work 01:10 PM -------

That went much better than last time. A few things I noticed:
- In work mode, I wasn't able to mark a subtask as completed unless I marked the whole task completed. This is problematic if I have more than one subtask and want to check them off one at a time. I want to be able to type x# to mark a specific task as completed.
- After completing all the tasks, I got this: "[DONE] Task journal updated." I want a reminder to take a break and then go back to my free writing to find out what needs to be done next.
- The statuses worked much better this time. However, the status message should be cleared when I move from triage to work mode. The last status from triage mode was distracting in work mode.
- Ignoring a line worked great for the most part. However, an ignored line reappeared after I moved a task to be a subtask of another one.
- Typing a# # gave me an error. It worked when I typed a # #. I want to be able to use either version. The same goes for the p command.
