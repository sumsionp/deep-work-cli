[] Test out DeepWorkCLI

I think this could be good. It's pretty cool that there are related tools, but they don't have quite the same workflow. I think this will fit my style better than the others described.

I am really worried that Julie had to respond to Customer. At least I assume that she felt like she had to.

[] Respond to Customer about the go issue

[] Do this tomorrow

[] Assign this one to another

------- Triage 12:27 PM -------
[] Test out DeepWorkCLI

Well, that went ok. However, it required my list to be more organized than I like. I want to be able to just think out loud in my editor and not worry about whether the thing I'm writing is important or not.

There was an error also when I completed all the tasks. It said: [!] ALL DEPTH REACHED
That shouldn't show what looks like an error. It should show a prompt to go back and do another free write session to find out what else needs to be done.

There was also another error. Let's:
[] Test out the error
[] This should be a subtask of the first task

The error was: Status: Error: not enough values to unpack (expected 3, got 2)

This happened when I typed a# # to assign a task as a subtask of another.

Also, there seems to be no ignore functionality. I should be able to type i# to ignore the entry at that line. That should remove it from my triage list, but not write anything to the file.

Two more things:
The last completed task was listed in my next triage session even though it was completed. This could be handled by triage ignoring any lines starting with a non-pending status, or a marker needs to be placed when moving from work mode.
