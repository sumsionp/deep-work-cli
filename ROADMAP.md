Future Roadmap:

Deadline Timer: Countdown in the Work Mode header for tasks with specific time-of-day deadlines.

Task Timer vs Work Mode Timer: Have an overall session timer and individual task timers. These will work like a stopwatch to track how long the session has been going and how long each task has taken. This could also be used to remind about taking breaks.

Auditory Feedback: System chimes for focus limits and deadlines.

Issues to Investigate:

Interuption Logic: I don't know exactly how it happens, but when I interupt a session with unfinished tasks and typing "q", it appears that the pending tasks are duplicated at the end of my free write at the bottom of the file.

Ignored Notes in Work Mode: Ignored notes are showing up in work mode. I think this has to do with the fact that there is flaw in the logic of the reordering vs ignoring. When I reorder the notes, then ignore a note, then assign a task, etc. Some things start to disappear or reappear in the list that have been ignored. I think it has to do with when a task is assigned as a subtask of another.

Triage and work markers not placed: After a triage and then "q", (I think), the triage marker doesn't get placed. A similar thing happens when exiting work mode via "q", although that may be slightly different. In any case, there is some strange duplication that happens. However, I think the duplication is technically expected except that there should be a marker between it to indicate it was part of a triage session.
